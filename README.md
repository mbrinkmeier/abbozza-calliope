[abbozza!](http://inf-didaktik.rz.uos.de/abbozza) is being developed by the working group [Didactics of Computer Science](https://www.inf.uni-osnabrueck.de/arbeitsgruppen/didaktik.html) at the [University Osnabr√ºck, Germany](https://uos.de).

## How to use

**abbozza-common** provides classes and files for the platform-specific IDEs. As such it is a prerequisite for the platform specific projects [abbozza-arduino](https://github.com/mbrinkmeier/abbozza-arduino) and 
[abbozza-calliope](https://github.com/mbrinkmeier/abbozza-calliope).

**abbozza-calliope** provides the interface and IDE for the [Calliope Mini](https://calliope.cc) and an installer.

## How to build

**abbozza-common** is a Netbeans Project. It provides the common classes and files for the projects
[abbozza-arduino](https://github.com/mbrinkmeier/abbozza-arduino) and 
[abbozza-calliope](https://github.com/mbrinkmeier/abbozza-calliope), which implement the IDEs for
the specific platforms. 

### Manual build

#### Preparations
Prepare a directory which may hold all required projects. In addition `ant`, and Java Developement Kit ( at least JDK 8)
nedd to be installed.

#### 1st Step
Clone the repository [abbozza-common](https://github.com/mbrinkmeier/abbozza-common):
`git clone https://github.com/mbrinkmeier/abbozza-common.git`.
Change into `abbozza-common` and execute `ant`.

#### 2nd Step
Clone the repository [abbozza-calliope](https://github.com/mbrinkmeier/abbozza-calliope) to the same directory
you cloned [abbozza-common](https://github.com/mbrinkmeier/abbozza-common) to (i.e. the project direcorties
abboza-common and abbozza-calliope are at the same level):
`git clone https://github.com/mbrinkmeier/abbozza-calliope.git`.
Change into `abbozza-calliope` and execute `ant`.

#### 3rd Step
Download the tool set for your operating system:
- [Windows](https://inf-didaktik.rz.uos.de/downloads/abbozza/tools/calliopeC/tools-win.zip)
- [Linux](https://inf-didaktik.rz.uos.de/downloads/abbozza/tools/calliopeC/tools-linux.zip)
- [MacOS](https://inf-didaktik.rz.uos.de/downloads/abbozza/tools/calliopeC/tools-macos.zip)

Extract the archive to an arbitrary path `<tools>`.

#### 4th Step
Set the arguments for running the abbozza-calliope project in NetBeans.
1. Right-click the abbozza-calliope project and chose *Properties* 
2. Under *Run* add the following *Arguments*:

   `-A file://<abbozza-calliope>/build/classes/ -T <tools> -B <abbozza-calliope>/build/classes/lib/buildbase.jar`

   Here `<abbozza-calliope>` is the directory of the NetBeans project and `<tools>`
   the directory in which you installed the tools in step 3.
